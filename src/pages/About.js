                        </span></span>, i'm frank bejo, i graduated 
                        at quezon city university with a bachelors 
                        degree in informartion and technology, when i 
                        graduated, like any other graduating students, i still dont know what
                        career do i want to pursue and skills i need to
                        develop but because covid 19 is still at peak that time and we're in
                        quarantine and you can't do anything at all, i started reviewing web
                        development, i remembered when i dont have have pc or laptop to code 
                        onto, but i have a phone, so i maximize what i have to review html css 
                        and javascript.
